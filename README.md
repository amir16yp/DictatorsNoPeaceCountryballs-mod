# DictatorsNoPeaceCountryballs-mod
My first attempt at modding a unity game<br/>
mod for the game [Dictators:No Peace Countryballs](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1139890/DictatorsNo_Peace_Countryballs/).<br/>
I cannot publish the source, since it is essentially a modified `Assembly-CSharp.dll`, which also contains the original's games code alongside mine. However, you can easily use JetBrains dotPeek or ILSpy to view the source code.
# Features
- The mouse panning speed being slow problem is fixed, one could also adjust the mouse panning speed by editing a file named `mouse_speed.mod` in the game's persistent storage folder (`%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\AarJeeBee\DictatorsNoPeaceCountryballs`)
- Country stats and saves are now editable. .dat files were migrated to json files. edit away!
# Install
extract the zip file from the releases page to the games binary folder (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DictatorsNoPeaceCountryballs`) and replace any files if it asks
# Future
I really tried to make custom countries a thing. I really did. but for now im a bit tired
